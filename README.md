# NestJS Skeleton
This is a skeleton application for NestJS with TypeScript.


## Initial Skeleton
In order to create a new skeleton application, I ran the following inside the node.js docker container.

```bash
$: nest new app
```
It creates a new folder named `app` with all example files and an endpoint `/` with `GET` method for Hello World message.
